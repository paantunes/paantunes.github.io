Business process crowdsourcing concerns the integration of the crowdsourcing strategy and business process management. Crowdsourcing is often an ad-hoc endeavor, e.g., allowing crowd workers to perform simple, independent tasks. Business process crowdsourcing empowers organizations to use crowdsourcing on a long-term, recurrent basis.

We defined an ontology of business process crowdsourcing, which regards crowdsourcing from a business process management perspective [1]. The ontology was built from a literature review on crowdsourcing. The ontology was evaluated against two automated ontologies generated from the same sources. These ontologies provide a holistic view over business process crowdsourcing.

We have also done an extensive literature review on business process crowdsourcing, which covers multiple fields of research. The results identify a set of fundamental factors influencing the decision to crowdsource [2], [3].
We have developed a process model of business process crowdsourcing [4], [5]. The model helps organizations establish repeated business process crowdsourcing patterns.

Based on the business process crowdsourcing ontology, we developed a tool helping organizations to make the decision to crowdsource [6]–[9]. The tool has been extensively evaluated, showing that organizations may benefit from its use [6], [8]. The major evaluation action involved about 200 participants making the decision to crowdsource [6].
The tool supporting the decision to crowdsource has been developed using the design science research paradigm [1], [10], [11]. The tool development has been extended and generalized beyond crowdsourcing to consider the support to evidence-based management [12].

In a related research stream, we researched how to bring crowdsourcing into research methodology, focusing in particular on theory testing [13]–[17].
