“Business Organization and Management.” 2020–2023. FCUL/PT. Master course. Synopsis: Develop knowledge about methodologies, processes and tools that generate effective, innovative and useful information systems. There is a particular emphasis on solving complex problems and exploring creative solutions. The adopted approach emphasizes reflection-in-action, using techniques for data gathering in the field, from primary sources, and techniques for active solution exploration, which are supported by rapid prototyping tools. Several design artifacts are generated: problem and solution frameworks, empathy and affinity maps, wireframes, storyboards, and project canvas. Syllabus: Theory: Design thinking, reflection in action, problem framework, needfinding, empathizing, wicked problems, empathy maps, affinity maps, solution framework, evaluation, peer review, storytelling, service model, prototyping, design science, design artifacts, storyboarding, managing design projects, design processes. Practice: Information systems design project. Practical application of information systems design methods, techniques and tools. Development of several design artifacts throughout the project. Group activities, including brainstorming, primary data collection, peer reviews, and demos.

“INFO411 - Design Science Studio.” 2019–2020. VUW/NZ. Honors course. Synopsis: This course teaches fundamental principles and methods of Design Science. The teaching mode pays tribute to the Bauhaus school, mixing theory and practice in flexible work/thinking spaces, which explains the word “studio” in the title. Teaching and learning in the Design Science studio fosters creativity, hands-on and solution-oriented attitudes, experimentation, prototyping, open exchange of ideas, and collaboration.
In the Design Science studio, learning takes over teaching, as students define their objectives and teachers provide support with insights, expertise and critiquing. We will emphasise, ideas over process, and exploration over prescription. We will combine technology, science and theory with the purpose to take wicked problems as inputs and generate actions as outputs.
The project assignments are open and will be defined in collaboration with students. We will focus on the development of artefacts with practical value. We will also foster teamwork.
